                        Website for an art studio based in London. This is an ongoing project, a multi page website with a very strict space handeling design. I have used Javascript and jQuery extensively for creating some of the features of the site, like a space optimizing responsive grid for navigating between elements inside a large project, a lens zoom effect to reveal subtle details and semi-fixed elements to accomodate the design.
                        As the site has many pages using the same layout, I utilized the features of Gulp and Swig for templating.

                        A single page website, created based on a free Behance web design by Vishnu Sathyan. I have used Sass to style the page. The gallery section presented a great oportunity for trying out Masonry, a grid layout library and experiment with CSS transitions for the captions. The conical gradient skills progression bar was drawn using canvas. In order to provide a great user experience across all devices I have made the site responsive.

                        This project was an enjoyable exercise to practice bootstrap. I have mostly experimented with the responsive grid layout provided by the framework, it was a great learning experience to solve the problem of the need for a margin versus bootstrap's margin unfriendly column layout with grid inception.
                        The project also presented a valuable lesson about optimizing taxing tasks in Javascript with the debounce function.

                        While completing an edX course on HTML 5 by W3C I came across the canvas element and got very enthusiastic really quickly. This is one of the experiments that I have built using Javascript on codepen. 
                        It is a kaleidoscope like effect with hexagons mirroring moving dots inside them.
